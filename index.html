						<li>So WHY ???</li>
						<li>Surely many of us have worked with a manager (not leader) who was all about "do this, in this way, by this time and then repeat 1000 times"</li>
						<li>The kind of manager that's just a bottleneck and strives to be irreplaceable, fueled by ego and insecurities</li>
						<li>The truth is that nobody is irreplaceable, so why don't just embrace the fact that your are repleceable and try to be exependable possibly to be replaced by somebody that have grown and learned with you?</li>
						<li>At the same time many want to grow and learn, want to get better at facing today's challenges and want to be ready to face more challenging tomorrows</li>
						<li>Well then the only way is trying to be expendable empowering others and give them ownership</li>
						<li>It is a way of building legacy and make room for others so that at some point in time the current leader can step aside, to keep growing in the same way his/her team can</li>

							<li>Narrative is ever evolving and must be kept alive</li>
							<li>Explicit objectives (WHAT): deliverying a given product or functionality, reaching a given outcome of a given plan, participate on a given process, but you have to narrow it down</li>
							<li>Firm Vision (FOR WHAT REASON): to learn a given thing, to scale up to a certain degree, to bring a value internally or to a customer, basically to grow</li>
							<li>Clear communication (HOW): to avoid misunderstandings, to align the group to the cause and its outcomes</li>
							<li>Constant feedback (HOW): fail fast recover quickly, to learn, to keep the alignemnt to the cause</li>
							<li>Support in difficult times (HOW): fire and forget will not work as per the above, to not let the team struggle alone</li>
							<li>I am going to share an experience with you that is about team leading but is narrowed down to the implementation of a given funcionality in the team, my point is that leading is not something that you can do on every scale, from being the CEO to being en engineer facing a given tech challenge</li>
							<li>--- Disco: the wip functionality was reviewed and evaluated periodically and the team was aware of the wins and the fails</li>
							<li>--- Disco: content distribution system needed to have a content staging functionality to let content editors approve content prior to releasing it to customers</li>
							<li>--- Disco: to bring value to the client and the customer, to offload work to non-tech folks, to learn</li>
							<li>--- Disco: the plan was created and agreed upon by every team member, the responsibilities were set</li>
							<li>--- Disco: the team needed to be unblocked or advised from time to time, needed to be taken care of given the difficulity of the task</li>
							<li>Let's stop for a moment and let's ask ourselves if these are things that exclusively the team led should take care of</li>
							<li>--- The answer if clearly no, if you manage to have every team member interiorizing the goals and the narrative around them you'll have everything you need</li>

							<li>how can you be sure that the team is aligned on the mission and vision? by being sure that everybody is speaking the same language</li>
							<li>Team agreements: it is not the lead deciding how to do things but the team, they commit to something they defined themselves, TAs are powerful because the define the rules to be part of the tribu</li>
							<li>--- Ecommerce: naming conventions, PR templates, commits messages, definition of done, no major prod releases on fridays -> Nuria shared some examples</li>
							<li>Playbook: set of rules / suggestions / strategies to follow when pursuing the mission, applies to teams whose mission cannot be easily narrowed down because of the variety of situations they have to face</li>
							<li>--- Architecture: Presales / Projects support / Tech excellence -> Templates, processes, handy material / weekly sync invites, prt, mentoring lines / chapters</li>
							<li>Docs: the most lean, updated and autogenerated form of documentation possible</li>
							<li>--- Ecommerce: Sync and Async docs, architecture diagrams, readMe</li>
							<li>Overcommunication: you end up creating a vocabulary that fits the mission</li>
							<li>--- Ecommerce: the magic happens -> non tech folks understanding tech stuff -> backoffice endpoints</li>
							<li>--- DISCO: the magic happens -> non tech folks understanding tech stuff -> fixtures as docs + dry run endpoints</li>

						<ul>
							<li>Start from the assumption that you have almost no context about your teammates, their history, their drivers, theirs fears, nothing</li>
							<li>Work as much as possible to unveil a percentage of themselves, who they really are, and create an enviroment in which they feel secure to share that</li>
							<li>You are not dealing with software engineers, delivery managers, UX/UI designers, but with people</li>
							<li>Only then the team will start to understand which are the pieces of the system</li>
							<li>And only then you can start to understand how the system behaves and reacts to internal and external forces</li>
							<li>Which are the inputs that make it rigid or elastic</li>
							<li>So that in the end you are able to understand how and when to apply pressure in order to increase the elasticity and not the rigidness</li>
							<li>E.g. Ecommerce: I was TL then I went off then back again as senior dev in the project</li>
							<li>E.g. Ecommerce: I knew the system and the pieces in it because I was there</li>
							<li>E.g. Ecommerce: There were 5 main backend services and huge frontend</li>
							<li>E.g. Ecommerce: the team was tired and unfocused</li>
							<li>E.g. Ecommerce: I did not want to apply more pressure to reach the deadline directly on the team</li>
							<li>E.g. Ecommerce: I decided to apply pressure on the TL given the fact that I knew how capable he was, he needed just some pressure and a bit of focus</li>
							<li>E.g. Ecommerce: I did not modify any equilibrium publicly</li>
							<li>E.g. Ecommerce: I divided the tasks and the backend services were 1 per person whereas the frontend was on the TL</li>
							<li>E.g. Ecommerce: I know for a fact that the teammates understood themselves as a physical system and better understood how to work together</li>

							<li>Potential trouble source: unpredictables because of up and downs sometimes they helps other times they destroy</li>
							<li>Suppressive persons: actively attempts to destroy behind a mask of trying to help</li>
							<li>We usually work whit the first 3 types and all of them are valid and create a good balance in every organization</li>
							<li>When it comes the team the only way to create a safe space is by using non negotiable values, usually companies have them</li>
							<li>Values are like team agreements on steroid and in the same way as the team agreements are tool that can be used by anybody</li>
							<li>I undirectly and directly have seen the damage done by the last two types of teammates</li>

							<li>Challenging & Achievable --- you cannot throw impossible stuff at your team</li>
							<li>Most of the times you'll have to walk the walk by divide and conquer</li>
							<li>You get one big, challenging yet achievable task and you'll have to sit together to</li>
							<li>--- planning, documenting, risk assessing and follow up its evolution</li>
							<li>--- and most important you do not have to expect that the HOW is your how but the WHAT is the proper what</li>
							<li>--- e.g. I should have followed the ppt template that dorado provided me for this KS but I decided not to and Jose is going to be happy about the WHAT and not the HOW</li>
							<li>E.g. Disco and storage choice, CosmosDB had bad performances, we had to really be sure about it and find a proper alternative (Azure Storages)</li>

							<li>Shadowing --- it may be needed, mostly the first times a given team member is facing a new challege</li>
							<li>E.g. Ecommerce the 4 backend microservices, I did one and shadowed the teammates when doing the others</li>
							<li>Reviewing --- it may be needed, mostly the teammate have already faced the new challegne but stil does not master it</li>
							<li>E.g. presales activities, coming up with and presenting a proposal to the client</li>
							<li>Backing up --- it is always needed when the first 3 things were not needed or possible</li>
							<li>E.g. I was on paternity leave and I just said "guys I wont be there, I completely trust you and your judgment and will back you up always no matter how bad you think you messed it up during my absence"</li>

							<li>--- they were not actively asking for a promotion but on the contrary just hempling everybody, walking the walk, supporting, celebrating, unblocking</li>
							<li>As before mentioned you'll end up doing a lot of shitty tasks as a lead but that's fine, because you jop is to clear the path for the others</li>
							<li>And in the end you'll have a team that would walk on path to complete a mission that is not horizontal, but it would, on average, have a grwoing trend</li>
							<li>and here come the importance of the transparency and openess, in order to make that path a growing one you'll have to deal with the context just above and just below it, giving to the team only the center one</li>
							<li>every time you communicate you should ask yourself "what for am I saying this" not "why" but "what for"</li>
